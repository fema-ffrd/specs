## ðŸ“‹ Technical Capabilities

### Overview

This section explores technical capabilities commonly found in modern orchestration systems that could support FFRD initiative flood risk analysis workflows. These capabilities include DAG-based workflow execution, container integration patterns, and operational features suitable for complex computational workflows. This exploration examines various implementation patterns and approaches available in contemporary orchestration platforms.

### Capabilities Framework

#### 1. Workflow Structure

##### 1.1 Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Support

- **Graph Definition**: Effective orchestration systems represent workflows as directed acyclic graphs with explicit task dependencies
- **Task Dependencies**: Systems should support expressing dependencies between tasks (e.g., Task B depends on Task A completion)
- **Parallel Execution**: Efficient systems execute independent tasks concurrently when resources allow
- **Conditional Execution**: Advanced systems support conditional task execution based on upstream task results or external conditions

##### 1.2 Workflow Definition

- **Declarative Format**: Well-designed systems support workflow definitions in human-readable, version-controllable formats
- **Reproducibility**: Reliable systems ensure identical workflow definitions produce deterministic execution behavior
- **Parameterization**: Flexible systems support parameterized workflows for different study areas, configurations, and datasets

#### 2. FFRD Container Integration

##### 2.1 Container Execution

- **FFRD Base Image**: Compatible systems can execute containers built on FFRD base image specifications
- **HMS Containers**: Suitable systems can execute HEC-HMS containers with appropriate Java runtime requirements
- **RAS Containers**: Capable systems can execute HEC-RAS containers with computational dependencies
- **Conformance Containers**: Supporting systems can execute validation and conformance testing containers
- **Plugin Containers**: Extensible systems can execute custom FFRD-compliant analysis containers

##### 2.2 Container Configuration

- **Configuration Files**: Effective systems support passing JSON configuration files to containers as specified in FFRD standards
- **Environment Variables**: Compatible systems support setting required environment variables for FFRD containers
- **Command Line Arguments**: Standard systems support passing command line arguments to containers
- **Exit Code Handling**: Reliable systems properly interpret container exit codes and handle success/failure states

#### 3. Volume Sharing and Data Management

##### 3.1 Shared Storage

- **Inter-task Data Sharing**: Effective systems provide mechanisms for tasks to share data through persistent storage
- **Volume Persistence**: Robust systems support volumes that persist beyond individual task execution
- **Storage Size Configuration**: Flexible systems allow specification of storage volume sizes (minimum 1GB, configurable up to hundreds of GB)

##### 3.2 Data Access Patterns

- **Read/Write Access**: Well-designed systems support both read-only and read-write volume access modes
- **Multiple Mount Points**: Flexible systems support mounting volumes at different paths within containers
- **Data Isolation**: Secure systems prevent unauthorized access to data between different workflow executions

#### 4. Resource Allocation

##### 4.1 Compute Resources

- **CPU Allocation**: Capable systems support specifying CPU core requirements per task (minimum 0.1 cores, typical 1-8 cores)
- **Memory Allocation**: Standard systems support specifying memory requirements per task (minimum 512MB, typical 1GB-32GB)
- **Resource Enforcement**: Reliable systems enforce specified resource limits to prevent resource contention

##### 4.2 Resource Constraints

- **Resource Isolation**: Well-architected systems isolate resources between concurrent tasks
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitoring-capable systems track actual resource usage against allocated limits
- **Resource Availability**: Intelligent systems queue tasks when insufficient resources are available

#### 5. Logging and Observability

##### 5.1 Execution Logging

- **Container Logs**: Comprehensive systems capture and store all container stdout/stderr output
- **Workflow Progress**: Transparent systems provide visibility into workflow execution status and task completion
- **Log Association**: Well-organized systems associate logs with specific workflow runs and individual tasks
- **Log Retention**: Configurable systems retain logs for completed workflows for specified periods

##### 5.2 Monitoring

- **Task Status**: Monitoring systems report status of workflow tasks (pending, running, completed, failed)
- **Workflow History**: Historical systems maintain records of workflow executions

#### 6. Error Handling and Recovery

##### 6.1 Retry Mechanisms

- **Configurable Retry**: Resilient systems support configurable retry policies for failed tasks
- **Retry Limits**: Safe systems support maximum retry attempt limits

##### 6.2 Failure Handling

- **Failure Isolation**: Robust systems prevent individual task failures from stopping independent workflow branches
- **Partial Completion**: Flexible systems support completing successful workflow branches when other branches fail
- **Failure Reporting**: Clear systems report which tasks failed and provide failure details
- **Manual Recovery**: Recoverable systems support manual intervention to recover from failures

#### 7. Integration Capabilities

##### 7.1 Data Sources

- **S3 Integration**: Compatible systems support integration with S3-compatible object storage for input/output data
- **File System Access**: Flexible systems support mounting external file systems for data access
- **Network Access**: Connected systems support controlled network access for containers requiring external connectivity

##### 7.2 Operational Integration

- **Workflow Submission**: Operational systems provide mechanisms for submitting and executing workflows

#### 8. Security and Access Control

##### 8.1 Access Control

- **Authentication**: Secure systems provide authentication mechanisms for workflow access
- **Authorization**: Controlled systems provide authorization controls for workflow execution
- **Credential Management**: Protected systems provide secure mechanisms for handling sensitive data and credentials

### Operational Considerations

#### Performance Expectations

- **Concurrent Workflows**: Scalable systems support executing multiple independent workflows simultaneously
- **Multi-node Execution**: Distributed systems support executing workflows across multiple compute nodes

#### Reliability Considerations

- **System Availability**: Reliable systems provide high availability for workflow execution
- **Data Durability**: Durable systems ensure persistence of workflow outputs and execution logs
- **Recovery**: Resilient systems support recovery from system failures without losing workflow progress

#### Compliance Considerations

- **Audit Trail**: Compliant systems maintain complete audit trails of workflow executions
- **Data Governance**: Governance-aware systems support data governance requirements for FFRD data
- **Documentation**: Well-documented systems provide documentation for operational procedures and troubleshooting

### Example Workflow Scenario

A typical FFRD workflow might include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Validate input configuration and download required datasets from S3
1. **Model Execution**: Run HEC-HMS hydrologic models with specified parameters
1. **Post-Processing**: Process model outputs and generate analysis results
1. **Validation**: Run conformance tests on outputs
1. **Data Upload**: Upload results to designated S3 locations

Orchestration systems supporting such workflows would execute these tasks in the correct dependency order, share data between tasks through persistent volumes, allocate appropriate compute resources, handle any task failures with retries, and provide complete logging and monitoring throughout the process.

This exploration of technical capabilities demonstrates the range of features available in modern orchestration systems while highlighting the flexibility organizations have in selecting implementation approaches and technology choices that align with their specific needs and constraints.
