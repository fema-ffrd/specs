# Workflow Orchestration

## üìê Standard

### Purpose

To document orchestration capabilities and requirements that can support complex, multi-step flood risk data processing workflows within the FFRD initiative. This standard explores how orchestration systems can provide directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), container execution, resource management, observability, and error handling to support reliable execution of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling workflows.

### Scope

This standard explores orchestration capabilities relevant to FFRD initiative workflows, including:

- Multi-step flood risk analysis workflow patterns
- Coordination approaches for hydrologic and hydraulic model runs (HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, etc.)
- Data processing pipeline management for stochastic storm transposition
- Conformance testing and validation workflow approaches
- Distributed computing patterns across multiple processing nodes

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Workflow Structure

- **DAG Support**: Orchestration systems typically provide directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflow definitions with explicit task dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Modern systems generally enable parallel execution of independent tasks
- **Conditional Logic**: Advanced orchestration platforms often support conditional task execution based on upstream task results

#### 2. Container Integration

- **FFRD Container Compatibility**: Orchestration systems can execute FFRD-compliant containers (base image, HMS, RAS, conformance, plugin containers)
- **Container Registry Support**: Most platforms support pulling containers from public and private container registries
- **Runtime Configuration**: Systems typically support passing configuration files, environment variables, and command-line arguments to containers
- **Exit Code Handling**: Well-designed systems handle container exit codes and propagate failures appropriately

#### 3. Resource Management

- **Compute Resources**: Orchestration platforms generally allow specification of CPU cores, memory limits, and GPU resources per task
- **Storage Allocation**: Most systems support dynamic and static volume provisioning with configurable storage sizes
- **Resource Constraints**: Mature platforms enforce resource limits and prevent resource contention between concurrent tasks

#### 4. Data Sharing and Persistence

- **Volume Sharing**: Orchestration systems typically provide shared storage mechanisms for data exchange between workflow tasks
- **Persistent Volumes**: Most platforms support persistent storage that survives task and workflow completion
- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Advanced systems support cleanup of temporary data when workflows complete

#### 5. Observability and Monitoring

- **Execution Logging**: Standard orchestration capabilities include capturing logs from workflow tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Most systems provide visibility into workflow execution status and task completion

#### 6. Error Handling and Resilience

- **Retry Strategies**: Modern orchestration systems support configurable retry policies for failed tasks
- **Failure Isolation**: Well-designed systems prevent individual task failures from stopping independent workflow branches

#### 7. Workflow Definition and Versioning

- **Declarative Format**: Standard orchestration systems support workflow definitions in human-readable, declarative formats
- **Version Control**: Most platforms enable workflow definitions to be versioned in source control systems
- **Validation**: Many systems provide validation mechanisms for workflow definitions (e.g., linting)

#### 8. Security and Access Control

- **Authentication**: Enterprise orchestration systems typically provide authentication mechanisms for workflow access
- **Authorization**: Most platforms provide authorization controls for workflow execution
- **Secret Management**: Modern systems provide secure mechanisms for handling sensitive data and credentials

#### 9. Scalability and Performance

- **Multi-node Execution**: Scalable orchestration systems support executing workflows across multiple compute nodes
- **Concurrent Workflows**: Most platforms support running multiple workflows simultaneously

#### 10. Integration and Interoperability

- **Workflow Submission**: Standard systems provide various mechanisms for submitting and executing workflows

### Implementation Considerations

- Immutable workflow definitions can help ensure reproducible executions
- Comprehensive testing strategies may be valuable for workflow validation before production deployment
- Designing workflows with failure scenarios in mind can improve reliability
- Documenting workflow dependencies, data requirements, and expected outcomes supports operational clarity
- Monitoring and alerting for critical workflow execution paths can improve observability
- Resource quotas and limits may help prevent resource exhaustion
- Security best practices for credential management and access control are generally recommended
- Maintaining workflow execution history can support analysis and troubleshooting
- Workflow approval processes may be appropriate for production environments
- Infrastructure as code practices can support consistent orchestration system deployment and configuration
