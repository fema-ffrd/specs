## üìê Standard

### Purpose

To ensure consistent validation of configuration files and seamless interoperability with Object Stores (starting with Amazon S3) for file upload and download operations.

### Scope

This standard applies to all systems and projects that require:

- Validation of configuration files against a defined schema.
- Uploading and downloading files to/from Amazon S3.
- Use of Python-based reference implementations for these operations.

### Guidelines

1. **Schema Validation**: All configuration files must be validated against a JSON schema before processing.
1. **S3 Operations**: File uploads and downloads must use secure, authenticated connections to Amazon S3.
1. **Containerization**: Reference implementations should be provided as container images for reproducibility.
1. **Interoperability**: All tools must accept configuration files and schemas in standard JSON format.
1. **Documentation**: Each implementation must include clear usage instructions and example commands.

### Best Practices

- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials.
- Log all validation and S3 operations for auditability.
- Follow semantic versioning for schema and implementation updates.
