# Workflow Orchestration

## üìê Standard

### Purpose
To provide a standardized, automated, and reproducible method for executing multi-step flood risk modeling pipelines within the FFRD initiative.

### Scope
This standard applies to all workflows requiring:

- Sequencing of multiple containerized tools for data preparation, model execution, and post-processing.
- Orchestration of HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models within larger computational workflows.
- Portable workflow definitions that can run across different orchestration systems.

### Guidelines
1. **Declarative Workflow Definition**: All workflows must be defined in a declarative, version-controllable format.
2. **Containerized Execution**: All tasks must run in containers using standardized FFRD images.
3. **Shared Storage**: Use persistent volumes for data artifacts shared between workflow steps.
4. **Parallel Execution**: Support parallel execution of independent tasks with dependency management.
6. **DAG Structure**: Define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to ensure clear dependencies and execution order.
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear usage instructions and workflow specifications.

### Best Practices
- Define explicit resource requirements and constraints for all tasks.
- Implement data validation at workflow boundaries.
- Log all workflow execution steps for traceability.
