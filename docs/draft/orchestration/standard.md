# Workflow Orchestration

## üìê Standard

### Purpose
To establish fundamental requirements for orchestration systems that can execute complex, multi-step flood risk data processing workflows within the FFRD initiative. The orchestration system must support directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), container execution, resource management, observability, and robust error handling to ensure reliable execution of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling workflows.

### Scope  
This standard applies to all orchestration systems used within the FFRD initiative for:

- Executing multi-step flood risk analysis workflows
- Coordinating hydrologic and hydraulic model runs (HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, etc.)
- Managing data processing pipelines for stochastic storm transposition
- Orchestrating conformance testing and validation workflows
- Supporting distributed computing across multiple processing nodes

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Workflow Structure
- **DAG Support**: Must support directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflow definitions with explicit task dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Must enable parallel execution of independent tasks
- **Conditional Logic**: Must support conditional task execution based on upstream task results

#### 2. Container Integration
- **FFRD Container Compatibility**: Must execute all FFRD-compliant containers (base image, HMS, RAS, conformance, plugin containers)
- **Container Registry Support**: Must support pulling containers from public and private container registries
- **Runtime Configuration**: Must support passing configuration files, environment variables, and command-line arguments to containers
- **Exit Code Handling**: Must properly handle container exit codes and propagate failures appropriately

#### 3. Resource Management
- **Compute Resources**: Must allow specification of CPU cores, memory limits, and GPU resources per task
- **Storage Allocation**: Must support dynamic and static volume provisioning with configurable storage sizes
- **Resource Constraints**: Must enforce resource limits and prevent resource contention between concurrent tasks

#### 4. Data Sharing and Persistence
- **Volume Sharing**: Must provide shared storage mechanisms for data exchange between workflow tasks
- **Persistent Volumes**: Must support persistent storage that survives task and workflow completion
- **Data Lifecycle Management**: Must support cleanup of temporary data when workflows complete

#### 5. Observability and Monitoring
- **Execution Logging**: Must capture logs from workflow tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Must provide visibility into workflow execution status and task completion

#### 6. Error Handling and Resilience
- **Retry Strategies**: Must support configurable retry policies for failed tasks
- **Failure Isolation**: Must prevent individual task failures from stopping independent workflow branches

#### 7. Workflow Definition and Versioning
- **Declarative Format**: Must support workflow definitions in a human-readable, declarative format
- **Version Control**: Must enable workflow definitions to be versioned in source control systems
- **Validation**: Must provide validation mechanisms for workflow definitions (e.g., linting)

#### 8. Security and Access Control
- **Authentication**: Must provide authentication mechanisms for workflow access
- **Authorization**: Must provide authorization controls for workflow execution
- **Secret Management**: Must provide secure mechanisms for handling sensitive data and credentials

#### 9. Scalability and Performance
- **Multi-node Execution**: Must support executing workflows across multiple compute nodes
- **Concurrent Workflows**: Must support running multiple workflows simultaneously

#### 10. Integration and Interoperability
- **Workflow Submission**: Must provide mechanisms for submitting and executing workflows

### Best Practices
- Use immutable workflow definitions to ensure reproducible executions
- Implement comprehensive testing strategies for workflow validation before production deployment
- Design workflows with failure scenarios in mind and include appropriate error handling
- Document workflow dependencies, data requirements, and expected outcomes
- Implement monitoring and alerting for critical workflow execution paths
- Use resource quotas and limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Follow security best practices for credential management and access control
- Maintain workflow execution history for analysis and troubleshooting
- Implement workflow approval processes for production environments
- Use infrastructure as code practices for orchestration system deployment and configuration
