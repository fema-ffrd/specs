# Key terms, definitions, and abbreviations


## Definitions

### Standards

**Definition**: A standard is a set of agreed-upon guidelines or norms established by an authoritative body or organization. Standards are used to ensure compatibility, interoperability, and quality across different systems and products.

**Purpose**: The main purpose of a standard is to provide a common framework or set of rules that can be universally applied across different projects, organizations, or industries. It helps ensure that products or systems can work together seamlessly.

**Scope**: Standards are generally broader in scope than specifications and may cover best practices, protocols, or methods that are widely accepted and adopted across the industry.

### Specifications

**Definition**: A specification is a detailed, precise, and formal description of a system's behavior, features, or interfaces. It serves as a blueprint for designing, building, and testing a software component or system.

**Purpose**: The main purpose of a specification is to communicate the specific requirements and functionalities that a software system or component must fulfill. It acts as a guide for developers and engineers during the implementation phase.

**Scope**: Specifications can be very detailed and may include data formats, algorithms, interfaces, protocols, and other technical elements required to implement a system or component.


### Schemas
**Definition**: A schema is a structured framework or blueprint that defines the organization, structure, and constraints of data within a database or system. Schemas ensure consistency and validate data inputs and outputs across systems.

**Purpose**: The main purpose of a schema is to provide a clear and unambiguous definition of data structures, enabling seamless data interchange and ensuring data integrity and validation.

**Scope**: Schemas are often used in conjunction with both standards and specifications. They define the format and structure of data, allowing for consistent data exchange and storage across different systems and applications.

### Reference Implementations
**Definition**: A reference implementation is a sample implementation of a standard or specification, provided to demonstrate how it can be applied in practice. It serves as a concrete example to guide developers in their own implementations.

**Purpose**: The main purpose of a reference implementation is to illustrate the practical application of a standard or specification, offering insights into potential challenges and solutions. It can also serve as a benchmark for testing and validation.

**Scope**: Reference implementations are typically provided alongside standards or specifications to help developers understand and apply them correctly. They ensure that different implementations are consistent with the intended design and functionality.

## Terms and Abbreviations

**Stochastic Storm Transposition (SST)**: a method used in hydrology to
estimate flood risk and precipitation patterns by virtually expanding
the historical record of storm events. SST involves randomly shifting
observed storms from their original locations to create new, hypothetical
storm scenarios based on realistic data.

**Study Area**: The watershed being evaluated for flood hazard and
flood risk using SST.

**Transposition Domain**: A wider area encompassing the watershed from
which historical observed storms are selected.

**Storm Catalog**: The collection of historical observed storms from
a transposition domain which are used for SST.

**Event**:

**Block**:

**Realization**:
