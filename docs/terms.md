# Key terms, definitions, and abbreviations

**Stochastic Storm Transposition (SST)**: a method used in hydrology to
estimate flood risk and precipitation patterns by virtually expanding
the historical record of storm events. SST involves randomly shifting
observed storms from their original locations to create new, hypothetical
storm scenarios based on realistic data.

**Study Area**: The watershed being evaluated for flood hazard and
flood risk using SST.

**Transposition Domain**: A wider area encompassing the watershed from
which historical observed storms are selected.

**Storm Catalog**: The collection of historical observed storms from
a transposition domain which are used for SST.

**Event**:

**Block**:

**Realization**:
