# Purpose and Scope
This collection of documents and resources serves a dual purpose in supporting FEMA’s Future of Flood Risk Data (FFRD) initiative. Firstly, it aims to enhance collaboration among various stakeholders, including governmental agencies, researchers, and community planners, by providing a shared understanding of flood risk data methodologies and tools. Secondly, it documents the development and application of essential tools that underpin the FFRD initiative, facilitating the creation of innovative solutions for flood risk management.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of these documents is to establish a standardized framework for the development and application of flood risk assessment tools. By articulating clear guidelines and methodologies, these resources ensure that all stakeholders have access to consistent and reliable information. This consistency supports effective communication and decision-making processes, enabling stakeholders to develop strategies that enhance community resilience to flood risks.

## Scope
The scope of these documents encompasses several key components:

 - Standards and Specifications: These documents outline the standards and specifications that guide the development of tools within the FFRD initiative. They ensure that all tools adhere to agreed-upon norms, promoting interoperability and quality across different systems and applications.

 - Schemas: By defining data structures and constraints, schemas facilitate accurate data exchange and integration. This ensures that flood risk data is both consistent and reliable, supporting comprehensive risk assessments.

 - Reference Implementations: These provide practical examples and benchmarks for tool development, illustrating how standards and specifications can be applied in real-world contexts. They serve as a foundation for further studies and analyses within the FFRD initiative.

Overall, these documents and resources lay the groundwork for the development of tools and methodologies that can be used not only within the FFRD initiative but also as a foundation for broader studies and analyses in flood risk assessment and management. They support informed decision-making and policy development, ultimately enhancing the nation’s preparedness and resilience to flood hazards.
